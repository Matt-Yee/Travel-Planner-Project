# Travel Planner Project

## Our application is a trip planner that dynamically builds a trip planner for the user based on the dates entered and lets them assign alternative activities for bad weather, and even tells them about the weather as projected for the morning, afternoon and evening.
Travel can be an expensive and uncertain endeavor, an organizational tool like ours can help you avoid the struggle of estimating costs in another currency and avoid expensive on the fly decisions when weather doesnâ€™t pan out. 
As a traveler, I want to be able to plan my trip such that I avoid going over budget and have an alternative activity planned for each morning, afternoon, or evening in case the weather is too bad for the activity I originally intended.

How to use the application
1. select location that you want to travel, The dates and how much your budget is, then click submit.
2. On the activities page you can select the activities that you would like to do and see how much those cost and subtract them from your budget. There is also a link to the currency converter page on the activities page that allows you to access the currency converter. 3. On the currency converter page you can hit the activities link to go back to the activities page, or you can enter in how much money you have, then select what kind of currency you want changed. For example enter in $100 and select from USD then to EUR and it will convert the $100 USD into $92.2 euros.
